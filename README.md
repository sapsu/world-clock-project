A World Clock app that displays date and time on different locations around the world.
The project was executed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The date and time information are updated from moment.js https://momentjs.com/
This was my final project for the SheCodes Plus Add-on workshop https://www.shecodes.io/plus-add-on
The app is hosted on Netlify https://heartfelt-douhua-7dce1e.netlify.app/
